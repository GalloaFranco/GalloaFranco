# Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40px"/>
My name is Franco, I'm from Argentina and I'm a Senior Software Engineer.

Today I'm working in [Fravega Tech]([https://mercadolibre.com/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fravegatech)) as a Backend Software Engineer in an e-commerce solution. I'm a proactive person, critical thinking, good teammate and problem solving. I love agile teams and I enjoy the synergy it generates.

I'm also working on side projects with friends...stay tuned!
